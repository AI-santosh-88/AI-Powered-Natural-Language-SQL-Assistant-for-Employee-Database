"AI-Powered Natural Language SQL Assistant for Employee Database"


ðŸ’¼ Business Use Case :

#### Problem:
Non-technical stakeholders often need access to data but don't know how to write SQL. Manual reporting or involving technical teams creates delays.

#### Solution:
This tool allows users to ask natural language questions about employee data (e.g., salaries, roles, counts) and instantly get results and explanationsâ€”powered by Google Gemini LLM and SQLite.

#### Impact:
* Speeds up data access
* Reduces dependency on data/tech teams
* Empowers HR, Finance, and Operations to self-serve analytics
